Telling rather than showing ('It was beautiful' is generic)\n3. Passive observation lacks emotional connection\n\n**Suggested Revision:**\n'Crimson and gold streaked across the western sky as the sun dipped toward the horizon. Sarah watched from the porch, coffee growing cold in her hands.'\n\n**Why this works better:**\n- Combines ideas for better flow\n- Specific details (crimson, gold) replace generic 'beautiful'\n- The cold coffee adds subtext - she's been standing there a while\n- Names the character immediately"
